## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs depend on the program, but it is a good idea to understand what the program is ultimatley for to ensure that the user needs are implemented in a way that
will leave the client satisfied. User stories help a lot with this since the prodcut owner can figure out the basic idea of what the users are asking for and 
summerize it in a clear and concise manor.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing it is important to have a plan, although too much planning and not enough developing will lead to no where. This is something that Agile helps resolve.
Agile can be used to create a short plan for a sprint then dive into developing then reviewing what was done to figure out how to begin the next sprint.
I hope in the future I can remember to keep a simple plan and jump into development when it is possible to ensure something is actually started.


## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member it is important to have the skills needed to ensure your team is not dragged down, but the real key is communication.
Making sure to keep the team updated and informed is important to making sure eveyones knows what is going own and opens up the possibility for great advice.
So I would say be open to communcate is important to being a good team member is software development and other aspects of life.
